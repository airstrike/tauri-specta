This branch contains code + examples for tauri-specta v2.
You can check the [v1.0.2 git tag](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/tauri-specta/tree/v1.0.2)
for the v1 code + examples.

## Getting Started

For most use cases, you'll probably want to use [v1](./docs/v1.md), which is stable.

You can also use [v2](./docs/v2.md) which supports generating types for events and utilises Specta v2,
but both it and Specta v2 are still in development.

## Known limitations

 - Your command can only take up to 10 arguments. Any more and you'll get a compile error. If you need more just use a struct.
 - Exporting your schema within a directory tracked by Tauri's hot reload will cause an infinite reload loop.

## Development

Run the example:

```bash
pnpm i
cd examples/app/
pnpm dev
```
